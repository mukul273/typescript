# TypeScript Tutorial

1. Install node js from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en),
2. `npm install -g typescript`,
3. Install 'Live Server' extension in vscode,
4. `tsc {your file name}.ts` - to compile and make js out of ts file,
5. `tsc {your file name}.ts -w` - to not need to compile for every time you make changes but -w (watch) attribute will monitor and make changes to js file automatically,
6. Most files contain self explanatory code, Please try to uncomment the code for better understanding and try to compile and you should get an error why the code will not work and why it's commented,
7.
